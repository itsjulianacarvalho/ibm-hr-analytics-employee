# Project: IBM HR data analysis

Objective: To understand the profile of the people who have left the company. This information can be important for preventing redundancies, reducing operating costs and improving employee satisfaction.

Questions that we will try to answer with the analysis:
- Is there a pay gap between men and women?
- Is there any evidence that gender has an impact on friction between employee and company?
- What is the relationship between salary and the department in which the employee works?
